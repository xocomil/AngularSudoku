# AngularSudoku

This is a project to create a Sudoku game using Angular. To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository from GitHub.
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/xocomil/AngularSudoku.git
  ```
2. If you have [volta](https://docs.volta.sh/guide/getting-started) installed, then the `node` version is already pinned.
3. We use [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) as the package manager, so use that to install dependencies.
  ```bash
  pnpm install
  ```
4. We use [nx](https://nx.dev/) to manage the project, so use that to launch the application.
  ```bash
  pnpm nx serve
  ```
5. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` in your browser to see the Sudoku game.
